# OTTO Recommender Systems Dataset
The OTTO session dataset is a large-scale dataset intended for multi-objective recommendation research. We collected the data from anonymized behavior logs of the OTTO webshop and the app. The mission of this dataset is to serve as a benchmark for session-based recommendations and foster research in the multi-objective and session-based recommender systems area. We also launched a Kaggle competition with the goal to predict clicks, cart additions, and orders based on previous events in a user session.
